## üí° Introduction
Current benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs primarily emphasize general knowledge and vertical step-by-step reasoning typical of STEM disciplines, while overlooking the distinct needs and potential of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Tasks in the HSS domain require more horizontal, interdisciplinary thinking and a deep integration of knowledge across related fields, which presents unique challenges for MLLMs, particularly in linking abstract concepts with corresponding visual representations. Addressing this gap, we present HSSBench, a dedicated benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs on HSS tasks in multiple languages, including the six official languages of the United Nations. We also introduce a novel data generation pipeline tailored for HSS scenarios, in which multiple domain experts and automated agents collaborate to generate and iteratively refine each sample. Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
* First, we introduced HSSBench, a novel dataset specifically designed for the HSS domain, which encompasses 6 distinct categories and 45 major types of HSS tasks.
* Second, we offered a practical data construction method. It utilizes a multi-agent framework tailored for the HSS domain, allowing batch generation of high-quality, novel datasets.
* Finally, we conducted detailed evaluations of over 20 MLLMs on HSSBench across six languages, verifying that HSS tasks still pose significant challenges for MLLMs. This work establishes a foundation for future MLLM research focusing on HSS and serves as a benchmark for future studies in this field.
